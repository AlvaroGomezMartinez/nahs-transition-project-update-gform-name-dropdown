This script is part of project that NAHS's social worker uses to collect teacher input
and create letters for students transitioning back to their home campus after their
placement at NAHS. This script references a Google Sheet that contains student names
and updates one of the dropdown questions so that teachers can select the name of most current
students enrolled at NAHS.
